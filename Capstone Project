Segmenting and Clustering Neighborhoods in Toronto: The Battle of Neighborhoods

1. Introduction: Business Problem 
The battel of the neighborhood is an important data science project targeting the clusters of similar types to provide a user to exploit this as a tool for an ample number of business choices. This project is based on the application of different data science techniques learned in the entire course. 

1.1 Objective 
With the given set of objectives, the battle of neighborhoods has been implemented for the exploration of data using Segmenting and Clustering techniques applied to the neighborhoods in Toronto. The objective of Applied Data Science Capstone is given as follows:

1), To learn about clustering and k-means clustering in particular.
2), To showcase this project in the form of the public repository using the GitHub platform.
3), To learn how to use the Foursquare API and clustering to segment and cluster the neighborhoods in New York City.
4), To learn how to use the Beautifulsoup Python package to scrape websites and parse HTML code.
5), To apply the skills acquired so far in this course to segment and cluster neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.
Aiming to achieve above objectives the data has been collected from Wikipedia page, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M . For this purpose knowledge of Python, Data Science, Visualization, Machine Learning Algorithms, Segmentation, HTML parsing, Repository site GitHub, and Foursquare is required. How do I utilize the complete program to build the “The Battle of Neighborhoods” project have been shown in the background section.

2. Data 
Based on the problem statement:

2.1, Following data sources will be needed to extract/generate the required information:, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M
2.2, centers of candidate areas will be generated algorithmically and approximate addresses of centers of those areas will be obtained using Geocoder
2,3 number of restaurants and their type and location in every neighborhood will be obtained using Foursquare API
2,4 coordinate of Toronto center will be obtained using Geocoder of well known Toronto location
2,5 The data frame will consist of three columns: PostalCode, Borough, and Neighborhood
2,6 Needs to process only those cells that have an assigned Borough. Ignore cells with a Borough that is Not assigned.
2,7 More than one neighborhood can exist in one postal code area. For example, in the table on the Wikipedia page, one can see that M5A is listed twice and has two neighborhoods: Harbourfront and Regent Park. These two rows will be combined into one row with the neighborhoods separated with a comma as shown in row 11 in the above table.
2,8 If a cell has a borough but a Not assigned neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the Borough. So for the 9th cell in the table on the Wikipedia page, the value of the Borough and the Neighborhood columns will be Queen's Park.
2,9 Needs to clean the data using appropriate methods.
